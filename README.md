# What is this?

Honestly, I just need a project that lets me learn a few things that interest me:

## Container creation
I know how to build containers, however it's not something I do with regularity. I'd like to shore up some of this knowledge, and perhaps put myself in a position to learn something more in-depth.

## CI/CD
What better way to learn CI/CD than a project that requirest building and deployment?
